I majored in mechanical engineering with a CS minor as an undergraduate here at UVA. As a mechanical engineer, I took a mechatronics class where we used a Propeller 2 Parallax microcontroller to program different things like LEDs, buttons, joysticks, and motors. For my capstone, our team used an Arduino board to program an IMU, EMG, and motor. I have less experience in computer architecture and OS because I only minored in CS, and I didn't take those classes. However, while classes I did take didn't go into the topics extensively, they touch on them briefly. Relating to programming languages I've used Python, Java, and C++ in CS classes. Other microcontrollers also used some version of C/C++ and their own finicky twist.
I'm interested in getting a more formal training on embedded systems. I'm currently an ECE PhD student under Dr. Sarah Sun. My advisor's lab focuses on wearable robotics so I'm hoping to learn a lot form this class. As I mentioned above, I have gaps in some fundamental knowledge relating to them. While I've been getting by with projects using them by looking things up online, I don't have a real understanding of how everything is actually working.
