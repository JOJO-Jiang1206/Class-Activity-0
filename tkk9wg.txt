Name: Marvin Rivera Martinez
UVA ID: tkk9wg

Background Experience:
I have a strong foundation in embedded systems through ECE 3430 where I earned an A last semester. 
My experience includes working with digital logic design (ECE 2330) and electronics (ECE 2600). 
I've completed essential programming courses including Introduction to Programming, Data Structures, 
and Software Development Essentials. I also have relevant coursework in Computer Systems and Organization II, 
which I will be a TA for this semester. Throughout these courses, I was taught Java, Python, C, Matlab, 
Verilog; I am currently working on self-teaching C++. Lastly, I also form part of
the Solar Car team where I have collaborated on projects in my subteam (Hardware Integration). 
My current focus is on Computer Engineering with a path on embedded systems.  

What I Want to Learn:
I'm truly excited to expand my embedded systems knowledge while taking complementary courses this semester
in Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, and IoT. I'm interested in learning advanced
embedded systems concepts and gaining hands-on experience through team-based projects. I am looking forward
to applying my programming and hardware knowledge to real-world embedded systems challenges and also very excited
about meeting new people.
