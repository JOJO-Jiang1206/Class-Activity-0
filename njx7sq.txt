I have taken Intro to Embedded Systems working in C on the STM32 platform
I have completed my Capstone last semester and developed an embedded system for the UVA
Swim and Dive team that measured force production from swim starts
I have also previously interned at a defense company that worked on embedded
software for software defined radios. 

I am hoping to get out of this class a deeper understanding behind design conepts
in embedded systems and working on a cool marketable project.
