Background: I took embedded systems last semester and taking computer
architecture this semester. I am proficient in mostly Java and C, but also
know Python. I have used STMCubeIDE last semester for embedded systems and 
engineered an STM32-based signal processing system with real-time ADC sampling,
DAC output, and flash memory logging. Also, I implemented memory mapping across 
SPI and I2C devices and optimized ReadByte() and WriteByte() functions for
efficient data handling.

Interests: After completing this class, I wish to be able to have a deeper
understanding of embedded systems and its design components. Moreover, I wish
to become quicker in reading and comprehending data sheets and work together 
in teams to succeed in creating a working design.
