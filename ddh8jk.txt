Background:
I have taken introductory courses in Embedded Systems, Computer Architecture, and Operating Systems. 
Last semester, I worked with the STM32 board and the x-nucleo-eeprma2, 
testing them using GPIO, FSM, UART, SPI, and I2C. 
Additionally, I simulated a RISC-V CPU and cache memory using Python.

Interest and Expectations:
In this class, I aim to integrate my knowledge of Operating Systems, Embedded Systems, and Computer Architecture. 
My goal is to build a unique project that combines all these areas.
